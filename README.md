# Description
This is my first IC design using Skywater 130 nm technology. I was designed Clocked Comparator for Final Project of Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuit purposes. To make the schematic, I use Xschem and forward SPICE simulation using Ngspice. For designe and layout, I use magic. And the PDK (Procces Design Kit) using Skywater 130 nm A. That all Linux software based (I use Ubuntu 23.04 LTS). This design consist of 23 CMOS transistor and already checked using LVS (Layout Versus Schematic) got match uniqly. You can see the final result in GDS File.
